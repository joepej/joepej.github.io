		<h2>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</h2>

		<hr class="line">
		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">
		The Man from U.N.C.L.E. spectacularly combines the buddy comedy and espionage sub-genres into a visually gorgeous and stupidly entertaining piece of action cinema.</p>

		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">Movie fans are spoiled for choice when it comes to "spy" movies this 2015. With Mission Impossible providing thrills, the Melissa McCarthy led Spy delivering laughs, and granddaddy of them all James Bond sure to leave many shaken and stirred with the upcoming Spectre, now comes a new contender in this spy game that does a lot of everything above and looks good while doing so.</p>

		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is an adaptation of the popular 1960s TV show of the same name, and under the whiz-bang direction of Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes) it could very well also be the latest action franchise to join a crowded field, so strong this first outing co-written by Ritchie and his producing partner Lionel Wigram.</p>


		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">Much like their successful reboot of Sherlock Holmes before it, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. succeeds thanks to the great chemistry between its two leads Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. They star as CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (respectively), rival spies who are forced to work together to stop a mysterious villainous organisation led by Victoria Vinciguerra ( perhaps the best looking fascist character to grace the screen, played suitably venomous by Elizabeth Debicki.)</p>

		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">Their only lead is Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander, playing it up after darker roles in A Royal Affair and Ex-Machina), the daughter of a German scientist coerced into building a nuclear bomb for the bad guys.</p>

		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">The dynamic between Cavill, Hammer and Vikander is strong, especially between the super-spies who trade barbs, fists and espionage tactics, while Vikander's Gaby looks on with eye rolling disbelief. The clash of Cavill's suave, smooth charm and Hammer's brutish, temperamental gruffness works in both visual and character. It's fun buddy comedy stuff, proving that Ritchie does indeed have a flair in conjuring great chemistry between his actors. (No, the Madonna bomb Swept Away doesn't count!)</p>

		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">Although Ritchie started his career with successful crime caper comedies Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, the British director has really found his niche in delivering big budget, Hollywood spectacle. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is striking in its style, kinetic in its energy, and has quite the wicked streak when it comes to its depiction of violence on screen (sometimes to its disadvantage, as shown in a particular scene where one doesn't know whether to laugh or wince.)</p>

		<p class= "wrap" id="reviewtext">Above all it is a fun movie that's filled with the kind of 60s retro chic that the Bond films used to have, a lightness that the Mission Impossible films could never attain, and a vibrant style that is all its own.</p>
